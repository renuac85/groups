# Group repositories for /groups

This repository was created to generate the list of repositories that will be used on /groups.

The following files are automatically generated by the server:

* [`repositories.json`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/repositories.json) contains all public repositories owned by a W3C group known to the W3C API `/groups`.
* [`all-repositories.json`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/all-repositories.json) contains all public repositories.
* [`identifiers.json`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/identifers.json) contains a mapping
between group IDs and group shortnames.

## Server

The list of repositories is generated by the code in [w3c/groups-server](https://github.com/w3c/groups-server/)

[`settings.json`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/settings.json) contains configuration settings used by the server. It may be edited manually. The current sttein options are:

* ``refreshCycle`` : how many hours between each refresh cycle from GitHub
* ``owners`` : an Array of the GitHub owner objects, as follows:
* * ``login`` : a string, identifying a GitHub owner, eg. ``w3c``
* * ``group`` : an array of zero or more integer. if a repository owned by the GitHub owner does not contain a ``w3c.json`` file, those group IDs will be used to associate the repository with a W3C Group

Note: the code is currently running within labs.w3.org.

## Others

[`repositories-schema.json`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/repositories-schema.json) and [`validator.js`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/validator.js) are used to guarantee and check the validity of [`repositories.json`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/repositories.json).

[`settings-schema.json`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/settings-schema.json) is used to guarantee and check the validity of [`settings.json`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/settings.json)
