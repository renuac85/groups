# Group repositories for /groups

This repository was created to generate the list of repositories that will be used on /groups.

The following files are automatically generated by the server:

* [`repositories.json`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/repositories.json) contains all public repositories owned by a W3C group known to the W3C API `/groups`.
* [`all-repositories.json`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/all-repositories.json) contains all public repositories.
* [`identifiers.json`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/identifers.json) contains a mapping
between group IDs and group shortnames.

## Server

The list of repositories is generated by the code in [w3c/groups-server](https://github.com/w3c/groups-server/)

[`settings.json`](https://github.com/w3c/groups/blob/main/settings.json) contains configuration settings used by the server. It may be edited by hands
