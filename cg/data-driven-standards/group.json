 "description": "The Data Driven Standards Community Group focuses on researching, analyzing and publicly documenting current usage patterns on the Internet. Inspired by the Microformats Process, the goal of this group is to enlighten standards development with real-world data. This group will collect and report data from large Web crawls, produce detailed reports on protocol usage across the Internet, document yearly changes in usage patterns and promote findings that demonstrate that the current direction of a particular specification should be changed based on publicly available data. All data, research, and analysis will be made publicly available to ensure the scientific rigor of the findings. The group will be a collection of search engine companies, academic researchers, hobbyists, protocol designers and specification editors in search of data that will guide the Internet toward a brighter future.",
