By knowledge domain we mean such human disciplines as mathematics, physics, chemistry and other STEM disciplines. We also include disciplines such as music, economics, history and linguistics. We are particularly interested in disciplines that convey knowledge using discipline specific symbology which cannot currently gain effective communication through HTML. We further include domain specific markup systems as well as graphical representation such as SVG rendering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This group may publish Specifications.</p>",
