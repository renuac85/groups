 "description": "<p>Bluetooth is a standard for short-range wireless communication\r\nbetween devices. This group is developing a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/\">specification\r\nfor Bluetooth APIs</a> to allow websites to communicate with devices in a secure and privacy-preserving way. In particular the web Bluetooth API focuses on minimizing the device attack surface exposed to malicious websites, possibly by removing access to some existing Bluetooth features that are hard to implement securely. Further, the API takes the approach of a user interface to\r\nselect and approve access to devices as opposed to using certification\r\nand installation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of our activity happens in our\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth\">GitHub repository</a>, with supporting code in adjacent repositories in the\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG\">WebBluetoothCG GitHub\r\norganization</a>.</p>",
