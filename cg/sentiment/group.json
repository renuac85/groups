 "description": "The Sentiment Analysis Community Group is a forum to promote sentiment analysis research. Topics addressed are:\r\n\r\n-Definition of a Linked Data based vocabulary for emotion and sentiment analysis.\r\n\r\n-Requirements beyond text-based analysis, i.e. emotion/sentiment analysis from images, video, social network analysis, etc.\r\n\r\n-Clarifying requirements and the need for consensus as e.g. systems currently use widely varying features for describing polarity values (1-5, -2/-1/0/1/2, positive/neutral/negative, good/very good etc.).\r\n\r\n-Marl and Onyx are vocabularies for emotion and sentiment analysis that can be taken as a starting point for discussion in the CG.\r\n\r\nThis group will not publish specifications.",
