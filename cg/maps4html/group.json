 "description": "<p>The Maps in HTML Community Group seeks to establish at least one hypermedia type which can be considered to be consumed by a (new) \"map\" element for HTML. Follow-on from Bar Camp at #lgd14. The objective will be to define a hypermedia type which can be linked to from a hypothetical (but prototyped in Web Components) \"map\" or (geo-map for Web Components) element which will provide simple mashup capabilities and user interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This group will publish specifications.</p>",
