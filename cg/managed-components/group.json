 "description": "The Managed Component Community Group aims to standardize the specifications and usage of Managed Components, an open format for loading third-party tools on the Web. Managed Components use a sandboxed server-side environment to run, making them more secure, private and performant than more traditional methods of loading third-party tools online. The group also aims to potentially pursue changes to browser and runtime APIs that will better support the integration of Managed Components.",
