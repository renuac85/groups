 "description": "The mission of this group is to propose foundational specifications relating to \"algorithmic modelling\": a \"model\", in this context, being a description of the composition and relative dynamic behaviour of the  sub-parts of a system, as exemplified by the Object Management Group's Model Driven Architecture.  The output of this group may then act as a reference point for groups requiring the use of specific types of models, conceptual and computational being two such.",
