 "description": "Argument-Representation's mission is to recommend a standardized representation for formal argument.  It is not intended to augment XML in any other way.\r\n\r\nThe group does not necessarily commit to creating a novel representation.  For instance, after due consideration it could endorse an existing one or recommend accepting an existing one with minor changes.\r\n\r\nFormal argument means a formalizable set of connected statements or statement-like objects intended to establish a proposition.\r\n",
