Other media formats containing in-band tracks may be considered.\r\n","shortname":"inbandtracks","discr":"w3cgroup","type":"community group","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/inbandtracks"},"homepage":{"href":"https://www.w3.org/community/inbandtracks/"},"users":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/inbandtracks/users"},"services":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/inbandtracks/services"},"chairs":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/inbandtracks/chairs"},"join":{"href":"https://www.w3.org/community/inbandtracks/join"},"participations":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/inbandtracks/participations"}},"identifier":"cg/inbandtracks"}
