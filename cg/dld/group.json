{"id":56439,"name":"Development Linked Data Community Group","is_closed":false,"description":"Data is commonly considered as a new kind of fuel powering economical, cultural and societal changes. From e-governance to smart cities, many examples can be found to argue for the value of open and connected data. By turning the Web into a data publishing platform Linked Data is a key enabling technology for this. \r\n\r\nIt has yet to be kept in mind that as of 2012 65% of the world does not have access to the Web and are thus deprived from Linked Data. Furthermore is this population sorely in need for the changes data-driven societies benefit from. \r\n\r\nThis community group is there to discuss some important questions such as: \r\n\r\n* How can development related data be published as Linked Data? \r\n* What kind of data is out there and what is relevant to drive societal changes in underprivileged countries? \r\n* How can those without Web access can consume open data set published as Linked Open Data? \r\n* How can the Linked Data principles be revised to be applicable in Web-less contexts?\r\n\r\nThis group will not publish Specifications.","shortname":"dld","discr":"w3cgroup","type":"community group","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/dld"},"homepage":{"href":"https://www.w3.org/community/dld/"},"users":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/dld/users"},"services":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/dld/services"},"chairs":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/dld/chairs"},"join":{"href":"https://www.w3.org/community/dld/join"},"participations":{"href":"https://api.w3.org/groups/cg/dld/participations"}},"identifier":"cg/dld"}
