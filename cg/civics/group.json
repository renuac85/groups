 "description": "Artificial intelligence is already having a big impact across domains, including government services. Users will soon be able to ask natural-language questions and engage in multimodal dialogues about large-scale public-sector financial, accounting, and budgetary data while receiving responses comprised of language, mathematics, charts, diagrams, figures, graphs, infographics, and tables. This Community Group will bring together those interested in civic technology, open government, and artificial intelligence to share and discuss how to ensure that the Web is well-suited for these applications.",
