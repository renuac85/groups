{"id":138124,"name":"Overlay Community Group","is_closed":false,"description":"Lately a set of web based accessibility remediation services has been made available to web content providers under the term: Overlay. These function by adding a snipet of javascript into a web content provider's page. Typically, this single line of additional code functions to enable, on each page load, additional content processing, delivered through the overlay provider's servers,  before the content is delivered to the end user. While this routing paradigm is by no means unique to accessibility applications, it does introduce accessibility opportunities and tradeoffs. In this community group we seek to clarify overlay technologies when applied for accessibility purposes, informed by sober analysis of what technological innovation at the edge can offer.
