 "description": "<p>The mission of this group is to establish a standard for creating a universally verifiable proof of any data, file, or series of events, by anchoring data to the blockchain and other sources. This allows anyone to prove the data existed at a point in time and has not been modified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group will publish and formalize the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chainpoint.org/\">Chainpoint specification</a> as a stable reference, maintain a test suite, and take feedback and use cases for the future evolution for the specification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chainpoint Community Group will coordinate with the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/blockchain/\">Blockchain Community Group</a> for general standardization of blockchain-related technology, and will operate according to the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chainpoint.org/w3c_chainpoint_charter.html\">Chainpoint CG charter</a>. You can read more about Chainpoint, its history, and goals, on our <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://medium.com/@WayneVaughan/chainpoint-a-standard-blockchain-proof-protocol-79def1c37189#.ayikplbdw\">recent blog post announcing Chainpoint 2.0</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This group invites participants who are actively developing and deploying proof-of-existence, timestamping, and data integrity solutions, who are skilled in blockchain technologies, and who can work on use cases for Chainpoint and related technologies.</p>",
