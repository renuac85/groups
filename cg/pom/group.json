 "description": "The goal of this CG is to develop specs to describe an object model for Publications (think EPUB, PDF, OOXML, and other complex friends) that hides the complexity of package, metadata and resource access inside those formats. A secondary goal is the development and release of a multi-purpose framework, in at least JavaScript and if possible c++ too, implementing those specs.",
